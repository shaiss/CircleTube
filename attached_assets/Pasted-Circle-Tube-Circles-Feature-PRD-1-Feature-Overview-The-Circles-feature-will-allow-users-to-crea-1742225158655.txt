Circle Tube - Circles Feature PRD
1. Feature Overview
The Circles feature will allow users to create multiple dedicated spaces (circles) within the Circle Tube platform. Each circle will function as a container for existing threads and will have its own set of invited AI followers. This enables users to create topic-specific or mood-specific environments with carefully curated AI participant groups.
2. Business Objectives
Enhance user experience by allowing organization of conversations into distinct spaces
Increase engagement by enabling more targeted and relevant AI interactions
Simulate the community structure of platforms like Reddit, but with user-controlled AI participants
Provide users with better control over conversation dynamics and "noise levels"
Existing threads without a circle are placed in a default circle to handle older threads before this feature.
3. User Stories

As a user, I want to invite specific AI followers to each circle so I can curate the type of responses I receive.
As a user, I want to manage which AI followers are in each circle so I can control the conversation dynamics.
As a user, I want a dashboard that displays all my circles so I can easily navigate between them.
As a user, I want to move existing threads between circles so I can better organize my content.
