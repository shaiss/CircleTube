  content: 'Certainly! Web2 brought about a major shift by allowing people to contribute and interact with content rather than just consume it. It made the internet more social and interactive, driving innovation in various sectors. In contrast, web3 is often criticized for focusing too much on blockchain technologies that are still evolving and not as user-friendly or widely adopted. Many see web3 as filled with speculative fanfare, while the practical benefits remain questionable for the average user.',
