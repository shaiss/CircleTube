# CircleTube AI Labs Feature - PRD Collection

## Overview

The AI Labs feature for CircleTube provides users with a powerful experimentation platform for testing and optimizing AI follower behavior. This collection of PRDs breaks down the implementation into modular components that can be developed independently while maintaining coherence as a unified feature.

## Implementation Approach

The AI Labs feature will be implemented in phases, with each phase building on the previous one:

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- Core lab creation and management
- Basic circle integration
- Initial database schema and API structure

### Phase 2: AI Integration (2-3 weeks)
- Follower selection and assignment
- Variation generation
- Group organization

### Phase 3: Content Management (2-3 weeks)
- Experiment content creation
- Scheduling and automation
- Scenario building

### Phase 4: Analysis (3-4 weeks)
- Metrics collection and visualization
- Comparative analysis tools
- Insight generation and reporting

## Current State

The Labs feature is currently in early development. Initial attempts at implementation have revealed a missing database schema component (`labCircles` table), which needs to be addressed before proceeding with the full implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the database schema implementation for the Labs feature
2. Implement the core Lab Management APIs
3. Develop the Lab Creation UI workflow
4. Begin integration with existing Circles and AI Followers functionality
