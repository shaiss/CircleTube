## Detailed Assessment

### PRD 02 - Studio Creation & Management

| Requirement | Status | Implementation Details |
|-------------|--------|------------------------|
| **Lab Creation** | ✅ Completed | Implemented lab creation with name, description, goals, experiment type |
| **Lab Management** | ✅ Completed | Lab list view, editing, status changes (draft, active, completed, archived), deletion |
| **Lab Dashboard** | ✅ Completed | Summary view, filtering by status, access to details |
| **Lab-Circle Association** | ✅ Completed | Can associate multiple circles to labs with different roles (control, treatment, observation) |
| **Lab Status Transitions** | ✅ Completed | Can change status between draft, active, completed, archived |

#### Key Components Implemented:
- **Data Model**: `labs` and `labCircles` tables created with relationships
- **API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for labs and lab-circle management
- **UI Components**: 
  - Lab creation wizard with multi-step process
  - Lab card view with status indicators
  - Lab detail dialog for viewing and editing
  - Status change functionality
  - Circle association management

#### Notes:
- The implementation matches the PRD requirements for Lab Creation and Management
- Added circle selection during lab creation process
- Implemented proper handling of lab status transitions
- UI components follow the design specified in the PRD
- The database schema allows for proper lab-circle relationships

The implementation successfully covers all the requirements specified in PRD 02.

### PRD 03 - Studio System Integration

| Requirement | Status | Implementation Details |
|-------------|--------|------------------------|
| **Circle Roles** | ✅ Completed | Implemented control, treatment, observation roles for circles in labs |
| **Database Schema** | ✅ Completed | Created lab_circles association table with proper relationships |
| **Circle Selection** | ✅ Completed | UI for selecting circles for labs and assigning roles |
| **Content Isolation** | ✅ Completed | Proper circle-lab associations to isolate content |
| **API Endpoints** | ✅ Completed | All required endpoints for lab-circle management implemented |
| **Collective Integration** | ⚠️ Pending | AI follower collective integration not yet implemented |

#### Key Components Implemented:
- **Data Model**: `labCircles` table created with proper relationships
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE endpoints for lab-circle management
  - Role management and assignment capability
- **UI Components**: 
  - Circle selection during lab creation
  - Circle management in lab detail view
  - Role assignment and modification interfaces

#### Notes:
- The implementation covers the circle integration aspects of PRD 03
- Core lab-circle association functionality is working properly
- The AI follower integration aspects still need to be implemented
- Next phase should focus on implementing lab_collectives table and associated functionality
