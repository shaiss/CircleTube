## Implementation Approach

The Content Studios feature will be implemented in phases, with each phase building on the previous one:

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- Core studio creation and management
- Basic studio system integration
- Initial database schema and API structure

### Phase 2: AI Integration (2-3 weeks)
- Collective selection and assignment
- Studio organization
- Collective management

### Phase 3: Content Management (2-3 weeks)
- Test content creation
- Content variation development
- Scenario building

### Phase 4: Analysis (3-4 weeks)
- Metrics collection and visualization
- Comparative content analysis tools
- Content insight generation and reporting

## Current State

The Content Studios feature is currently in early development. Initial attempts at implementation have revealed a missing database schema component (`studioTables` table), which needs to be addressed before proceeding with the full implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the database schema implementation for the Content Studios feature
2. Implement the core Studio Management APIs
3. Develop the Studio Creation UI workflow
4. Begin integration with existing Circle System and AI Collective functionality
